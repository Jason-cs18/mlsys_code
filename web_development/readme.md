# Developing a simple web app with React and FastAPI

Code for [Blog: Building a Web Application with React](https://jason-cs18.github.io/mlsys/blog/code/react_web). 

The example web app offers an image classification service to users. It consists of three main pages: the landing page, the application page, and the admin page. Upon entering the web app, users are greeted with the landing page, which serves as the entry point. The application page is where users can access and utilize the image classification service. Meanwhile, the admin page is reserved for administrators, who can manage and oversee the service from this dedicated management page.
